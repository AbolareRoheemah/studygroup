Process to approach your first issue

1. Understand the repositories architecture and functions (e.g., if a repo is about EIP make sure you understand the structure of EIPs)
2. Check the reported issue and make sure you understand what is asked of you
3. Create a fork of the repository and clone your fork to your local machine
4. Run the code and reproduce the same behaviour
5. Clarify all open questions from the issue. Make sure you dive deep into the repo before asking questions but also donâ€™t waste time getting lost. Most of the time, when formulating a question, everything will become clear.
6. If the coding language is unfamiliar to you, do a simple introduction course
7. Maybe try test first approach, where you write the test first to make sure to check for the error that occurs
8. Implement your solution
9. Write tests )if you haven't done it yet
10. Write documentation (based on how documentation is done in that repository)
11. Create a PR mentioning the Issue and explaining the solution
