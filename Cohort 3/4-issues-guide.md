## How-to Guide  

### **1. Understand the Repository's Architecture**  

- Read the README.md and contributor documentation.  
- Explore past PRs to see how similar issues were solved.  

### **2. Analyze the Issue**

- Read the issue carefully and try to fully understand what is required.  
- If anything is unclear, take time to research before asking questions.  

### **3. Clarify Open Questions**

- Don't hesitate to ask for clarifications in the issue comments or the relevant Discord channel.  
- Before asking, try to troubleshoot yourself — writing down your thought process often helps.  
- Keep questions concise and specific to avoid unnecessary back-and-forth.  

### **4. Learn the Required Tech Stack**

- If you're unfamiliar with the coding language, take a quick introductory course to understand its basics.
- Use AI tools and coding assistants for a quick dive into a new language or to get explanations of unfamiliar concepts.
- Check the repository’s coding style and best practices before writing your solution.

### **5. Implement Your Solution**

- Write your fix while following the repository’s best practices.  
- Keep your implementation clean, maintainable, and within the scope of the issue.  

### **6. Write and Run Tests**

- If required, write new tests to verify your changes.  
- Run the client's test suite and confirm that all tests pass before submitting your PR.

### **7. Update Documentation or Changelogs (If Required)**

- Some issues require updates to client documentation or changelogs.  
- Follow the repository’s documentation style and update the relevant files if your fix introduces a new feature or modifies existing behavior.  
- Ensure the changelog reflects important modifications before opening your PR.  

### **8. Open a Pull Request**

- Open a PR using the client's template.
- Reference the issue in the PR (`Fixes #123`).
- Explain what changes you made and why.  
- Follow the PR guidelines outlined in the [GitHub Guide – Contributing to Ethereum Clients](./3-github-guide.md#contributing-to-ethereum-clients).

If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the [WiEP Discord](https://discord.com/invite/JvEVfKBY6W) study-group channel or the relevant client's Discord server.
