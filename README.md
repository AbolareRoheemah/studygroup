# WiEP Study Group

A study group initiated by Women in Ethereum Protocol to increase contribution to the Ethereum ecosystem. Learn more about our group with [WiEP Handbook](https://hackmd.io/@poojaranjan/WiEPHandbook).

This is not a standard format study group where we will study but instead we will focus on doing more hands-on stuff in pairs.

Check out the different cohorts to learn more about the participants and the issues that they have resolved.

This study group is focused on more advanced developers with at least 1 year coding experience.
