# Women in Ethereum Protocol (WiEP) Study Group

Welcome to the **Women in Ethereum Protocol (WiEP) Study Group**! The goal of this initiative is to create a supportive and inclusive environment for women interested in contributing to the Ethereum protocol. Continue reading to learn more about our mission, how the study group is structured, and how you can get involved.

## What is WiEP?

**Women in Ethereum Protocol (WiEP)** is a community committed to bringing gender diversity within the Ethereum ecosystem. Initiated by the Ethereum Foundation and Ethereum Cat Herders, WiEP aims to drive the Ethereum protocol toward a decentralized future where every voice is heard, and ensure that contributors of all genders feel valued, inspired, and supported. Our mission is to make diversity the norm, not the exception, in the Ethereum ecosystem. Learn more about WiEP in the [WiEP Handbook](https://hackmd.io/@poojaranjan/WiEPHandbook).

## What is the WiEP Study Group?

The **WiEP Study Group** is an initiative to provide a hands-on, supportive community for learning the Ethereum protocol. Unlike a traditional study group, our focus is on practical, project-based collaboration.

### Key Features

- **Learn Together:** Participate in collaborative, hands-on sessions focused on the Ethereum protocol.  
- **Build Community:** Connect and network with others passionate about Ethereum and blockchain technology.  
- **Skill Development:** Enrich your technical skills by contributing to open-source projects and exploring the protocol under the hood.  
- **Mentorship and Support:** Access mentors, resources, and guidance to help you succeed throughout your learning journey.  
- **Empowerment:** Encourage more women to actively contribute to the Ethereum protocol and make their first Pull Request.

This study group is primarily intended for intermediate to advanced developers with at least one year of coding experience. If you are newer to coding or the Ethereum ecosystem but feel motivated to dive in, we encourage you to give it a try! Please note that a GitHub account is required for participation.
