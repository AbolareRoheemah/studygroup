---

- **How do I know when the program starts?**  
    - WiEP hosts two cohorts each year—one in spring and another in autumn. They’re announced in advance. Fill out our sign-up form, follow us on X, and join our Discord server to stay informed about important dates and announcements.

- **Is there a selection process?**  
    - Yes. Depending on the number of applications, we may check your GitHub account to ensure participants meet basic requirements.

- **I don’t know much about the Ethereum Protocol. Can I still apply?**  
    - Yes. Gaps in knowledge are expected. We ask that you have at least some coding experience and a strong motivation to learn. If you feel inspired to dive in, we still encourage you to apply. Our [Resources](./resources.md) can help you get up to speed on protocol fundamentals.

- **Will I learn how to build smart accounts and dApps on the Ethereum blockchain?**  
    - No. This program primarily focuses on protocol-level contributions rather than building decentralized applications (dApps). Participants often work on GitHub issues related to Ethereum clients.

- **What issues can I work on?**  
    - We suggest specific repositories depending on current mentors. Participants can choose any Ethereum client from the core protocol and work on it independently or collaboratively. We encourage open-source contributions that help advance Ethereum’s decentralized future.

- **Is the WiEP Study Group remote?**  
    - Yes. WiEP is global and operates primarily online. We do our best to accommodate participants from different time zones.

- **Will I get paid?**  
    - No. This is a free initiative, and there is no financial compensation for participation.

- **How many participants will be accepted?**  
    - The number of participants depends on the volume of applications and the capacity of our mentors. We aim to form cohorts that can effectively collaborate and learn together.

- **What happens after the program ends?**  
    - We encourage you to continue contributing to Ethereum protocol development. While there is no guarantee of employment or funding afterward, your experience here can help you pursue future opportunities in the Ethereum ecosystem.
